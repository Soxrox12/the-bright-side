   <p style="text-align:left">Hi, it's Hannah here! I'm going to be a senior in high school this fall, but the catch is: I'm homeschooled! I'm also taking Chemistry, English, and Calculus With Analytic Geometry at my local college. I have always loved technology and have known since middle school that I wanted a career in computer science. My dream job is either working at Nintendo in Japan or for Ubisoft on Just Dance. In my free time, I love dancing, specifically urban dance. I had the idea for a medical website targeted at teenagers because I have several medical conditions myself and want to spread awareness.</p>
